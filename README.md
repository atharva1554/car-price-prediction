## Introduction

The car market is vast and diverse, with prices influenced by numerous factors such as brand, model, age, mileage, and features. Accurately predicting car prices can help buyers make informed decisions and sellers set competitive prices. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze historical data and predict car prices based on various attributes.

## Data

The dataset used in this project includes various features that impact car prices, such as:
- Brand
- Model
- Year of manufacture
- Engine size
- Mileage
- Fuel type
- Transmission type
- Number of doors
- Number of seats
- Other relevant features

## Models

Several machine learning models were explored, including:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Each model was evaluated based on its prediction accuracy and other relevant metrics.

## Results

The results of our models, including their performance metrics and visualizations, are stored in the `results/` directory. This includes plots comparing actual vs. predicted prices and other analyses.

## Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/atharva1554/car-price-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd car-price-prediction
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment and activate it (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To start using the project, you can explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory, where you will find detailed steps for data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation. The `scripts/` directory also contains Python scripts for specific tasks such as data processing and model training.
